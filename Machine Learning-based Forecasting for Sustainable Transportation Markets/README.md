# Project - Machine Learning-Based Forecasting for Sustainable Transportation Markets

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
This project focuses on forecasting the sales of electric vehicles from 2025 to 2035 using machine learning and deep learning techniques. In recent years, a large growth in the automotive industry has brought a great challenge to plan the appropriate supply of necessary materials. The goal of this project is to provide data-driven decisions into the sustainable transportation markets as well as the manufacturing and policy development across different geographic regions.

## Dataset
<p align="justify">
The dataset contains sales data spanning the years from 2010 to 2035 including historical sales records (2010-2024) and forward-looking projections (2025-2035). Each entry includes 8 columns capturing key annual metrics (i.e. region, powertrain type, parameter). Preprocessing techniques are applied to the dataset to ensure optimal performance.
