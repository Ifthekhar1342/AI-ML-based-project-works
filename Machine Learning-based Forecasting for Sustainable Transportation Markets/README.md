This project focuses on forecasting the sales of electric vehicles from 2025 to 2035 using machine learning and deep learning techniques. In recent years, a large growth in the automotive industry has brought a great challenge to plan the appropriate supply of necessary materials. The goal of this project is to provide data-driven decisions into the sustainable transportation markets as well as the manufacturing and policy development across different geographic regions.
