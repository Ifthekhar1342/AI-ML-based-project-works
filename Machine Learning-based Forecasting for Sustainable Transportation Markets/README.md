# Project - Machine Learning-Based Forecasting for Sustainable Transportation Markets

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
This project focuses on forecasting the sales of electric vehicles from 2025 to 2035 using machine learning and deep learning techniques. In recent years, a large growth in the automotive industry has brought a great challenge to plan the appropriate supply of necessary materials. The goal of this project is to provide data-driven decisions into the sustainable transportation markets as well as the manufacturing and policy development across different geographic regions.

## Dataset
<p align="justify">
The dataset contains sales data spanning the years from 2010 to 2035 including historical sales records (2010-2024) and forward-looking projections (2025-2035). Each entry includes 8 columns capturing key annual metrics (i.e. region, powertrain type, parameter). Preprocessing techniques are applied to the dataset to ensure optimal performance.

## Project Workflow
### Step 1: Data Exploration
<p align="justify">
Analyzed the features to identify the detailed trend analysis that could help with predictive modeling for the future of electric mobility across different markets. 
</p>

### Step 2: Feature Engineering
<p align="justify">
Provide a clear view of annual market performance for each region using aggregated yearly unit sales, sales growth trajectory over time, and acceleration or deceleration patterns of market growth.
</p>

### Step 3: Data Visualization
<p align="justify">
Line plots, bar charts, and a heatmap were used to visualize global and regional sales trends, powertrain-wise growth, top-selling regions, and yearly distribution patterns.
</p>

### Step 4: Model Training and Evaluation
<p align="justify">

*  Data preprocessing: This dataset was filtered to include only relevent annual sales data. Total yearly sales were aggregated as well as features (x) and targets (y) were defined accordingly. The data was then split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio to evaluate model performance effectively.
</p>
  
*   Algorithms used: To predict future sales trends based on historical data, the following machine learning regression algorithms were employed:
    1. #### Linear Regression
    2. #### Ridge Regression
    3. #### Lasso Regression
    4. #### ElasticNet Regression
    5. #### Decision Tree Regressor
    6. #### Random Forest Regressor
    7. #### Gradient Boosting Regressor
    8. #### AdaBoost Regressor
    9. #### Support Vector Regressor
    10. #### K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
    11. #### Multi-Layer Perception Regressor
