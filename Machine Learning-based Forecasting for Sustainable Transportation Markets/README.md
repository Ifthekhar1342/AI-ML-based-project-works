## Introduction
<p align="justify">
This project focuses on forecasting the sales of electric vehicles from 2025 to 2035 using machine learning and deep learning techniques. In recent years, a large growth in the automotive industry has brought a great challenge to plan the appropriate supply of necessary materials. The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights into the rising sales trajectory of electric vehicles as well as the adoption of various powertrain types (i.e. BEV, FCEV, PHEV) and their distribution across different geographic regions.
