# Introduction
<p align="justify">
The adoption of AI-based applications is rapidly growing in the modern world across various sectors including intelligent traffic systems and autonomous vehicles. These applications are heavily relied on real-time object detection to function safely and efficiently. I developed a project to identify vehicles by using computer vision techniques from road scene images on the roads of Bangladesh. This project not only focuses on the application of state-of-the-art object detection methods but also contributes toward the development of region-specific autonomous vehicle and traffic monitoring systems.
