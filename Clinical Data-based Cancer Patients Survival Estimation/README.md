# Project - Clinical Data-based Cancer Patients Survival Estimation

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
The project focuses on predicting survival outcomes of cancer patients using machine learning models. The models are trained on synthetic clinical data with an emphasis on lung, stomach, and liver cancer. Different machine learning algorithms are applied and evaluated to build predictive models to estimate survival probabilities. The project also highlights the role of regional disparities and lifestyle factors in cancer prognosis.

## Dataset
The datasets used in this project reflects actual cancer epidomology trends associated with patient lifestyle, charactorstics of cancer, treatment information, and survival status. The dataset contains 10000 unique patient records and 20 features. 
## Objective
The goal of this project is to assist in early prognosis, identify critical risk factors, and support data-driven decisions.
